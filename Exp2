1. What is the relationship between tic-tac-toe and magic square?
 Tic-tac-toe and magic squares have a connection in their structure and patterns, especially when looking at the classic 3x3 versions of both games. In a 3x3 magic square, each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same sum, called the magic constant. This structure is reminiscent of tic-tac-toe, where players aim to create a line of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
In essence, a 3x3 magic square can be interpreted as a solved game of tic-tac-toe. Each number in the magic square corresponds to a player's move, and achieving the magic constant in every row, column, and diagonal mirrors the objective of winning tic-tac-toe.
Conversely, the strategies used in tic-tac-toe, like blocking opponents and aiming for specific patterns, can be applied when constructing or solving magic squares, especially in larger grids where the complexity increases.
So, while they are different games with different goals, tic-tac-toe and magic squares share similarities in terms of pattern recognition, strategic thinking, and arranging elements within a grid.

2. What is a magic square of order n?
A magic square of order n is a square grid containing n×n cells, where each cell typically contains a distinct integer from 1 to 2 n2, and the sum of the integers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. This sum is known as the "magic constant."
The properties of a magic square of order n include:
1.	The numbers used in the square usually start from 1 and increase sequentially up to n^2.
2.	The sum of each row, column, and diagonal in the square equals the same magic constant.
3.	There are 22 main types of magic squares:
•	"Normal" magic squares: Each cell contains a unique integer from 1 to n^2.
•	"Panmagic" squares: In addition to the above properties, the broken diagonals (diagonals not containing the center cell) also sum up to the magic constant.
Magic squares have fascinated mathematicians for centuries due to their intriguing properties and patterns. They have applications in various fields such as recreational mathematics, art, and even cryptography.
